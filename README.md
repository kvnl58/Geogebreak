Open html in a browser to open app.

Add tags in the code that will be replaced by their respective variable names. For example, a javascript to get the value of a text object with the tag 't' would look like this:

var a = ggbApplet.getValueString('#t');

If you want to create an InputBox you will need to specify to what object the inputbox is linked to by putting the name of the object as the value of the inputbox.
